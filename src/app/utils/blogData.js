      "Micro-services in this era is getting so much attention from articles, social media, conference presentation, blogs, and so on. However, despite the hype, Micro-service architecture has significant benefits, highly recommended for agile or RAD and the delivery of complex enterprise applications.",

      "Micro-services also known as Micro-service architecture is a method of designing or developing software applications or systems to structure one application as a collection of loosely coupled services.",

      "If we more explore, everyone has a different explanation about micro-services.",

      '"Someone says: ”Micro-services are small services that work together.”',

      "Other-one says: “The microservice architectural style is an approach to develop a single application as a suite of small services”. There are so many definitions available for microservices.”",

      'Wikipedia has a good definition for microservices: "structural style that arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services”',

      "In the end, everything comes to a point and concludes: “Micro-services is a software architecture that eases software development and maintenance”.",

      "In this article we will cover:",

      "What should be remembered while working with Micro-services? Features of micro-services Pros of Micro-services Top worldwide real-life examples Where Mindefy used micro-services Why do we need microservice architecture?",

      "Each component of a microservice has its own:",

      "Runtime Environment, A dedicated team works on it, ensuring they are working and each service is distinct from the other.",

      "This architecture defines that every single service can run its own unique process. And each service can communicate continuously without having to rely on the other services",

      "What should be remembered about Micro-services?",

      "Microservices are exposed by REST. Microservices are small and well-chosen deployable units. It is Event-driven interaction between the services",

      "Features of Micro-service :",

      "Decoupling: Services within a system are largely decoupled. So the application as a whole can be easily built, altered, and scaled.&nbsp; Agility: Any new feature can be quickly developed and discarded again. Business Capabilities: Microservices are very simple and focus on a single capability. Autonomy: Developers and teams can work independently of each other, thus increasing speed. Continuous Delivery: Allows frequent releases of software, through systematic automation of software creation, testing, and approval. Responsibility: Microservices do not focus on applications as projects. Instead, they treat applications as products for which they are responsible. Componentization: Microservices are treated as independent components that can be easily replaced and upgraded Decentralized Governance: Developers have the freedom to choose the best useful tools to solve their problems. That means there is no standardized pattern or any technology pattern.",

      "Pros of Microservices:",

      "Increase Agility, Improve workflows, ndependent development of services, Independent deployment of services, Easy maintenance, Developer Independent",

      "Top Worldwide examples of Microservices:",

      "Amazon, Netflix, Uber, Twitter, Paypal",

      "Where Mindefy used Micro-services:",

      "We’ve used Micro-services in fraud management solutions, Retail management Projects, and so on.",

      "Why we need Microservice architecture:",

      "More Agility: In this technology era, all industries continue to accelerate with the pace. To meet user expectations and exceed expectations, introducing new features and capabilities, our applications need to evolve. So by using containers or container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes/docker to deploy applications. Micro-service architecture helps to faster the process. In Monolithic, it takes too much time from development to deployment.",

      "Reduced Cost: Micro-service helps to reduce costs. The main idea of MS is “small unit distribution”. And these small units can be managed by a single person or with very less people involved. Better Experience: The drive to innovate applications into Micro-service architecture. Micro-service helps to improve user experience as well as developer experience. Developers are also happy to implement micro-services cause it is easy to understand and implement. And this satisfaction makes the user experience great.",

      "Hope You have enjoyed this article and come to know what Micro-service is.",

      "Work From Home is fast turning into the new normal!",
      "Companies, in the face of this global pandemic, have asked their employees to Work From Home. While these measures are aimed at staunching the spread of the coronavirus, the work does not stop. This, however, seems to be easier said than done. Chances are, if you’re not a freelancer or a WFH veteran, you find the environment not conducive to work. It is important that you establish certain things in order to be more productive. And, even though we cannot go on living as if nothing’s wrong, we need to put out the work our employers expect from us. Here are a few tips on how to be a good employee and not lose your work ethic while working from home.",
      "And so the call for time management has echoed like a battle cry across the world. With organizations lobbying for better or reduced work hours, better working conditions, more efficient tools to work with, it seems like time management is the only viable solution to getting things done. And though there is no dearth of strategies to manage your time, we have shortlisted four of the best ways to manage time.",
      "Work Area!",
      "The atmosphere of a home and an office are very different. To that end, one feels that a corner of your home can be converted into a workspace of sorts. It is crucial that you have a desk where you have all the things that you need. Try to limit the number of times that you get up from your desk to go fetch implements that you need. Which leads us to our next point:",
      "It is important to create a healthy working environment while working from home!",
      "Block Distractions!",
      "At the office, it is important to create an environment that does not provide easy distractions. So, get away from it all. Try to do away with all the noise of the household as daily life unravels around you as you try to work. Remember: noise is sound that comes at irregular intervals and disturbs us. But if you are one of those people who need at least some sort of noise, try to have a dull sound playing in the background. White noise, research has suggested, is conducive to a work environment. It is also important that you establish ground rules with your family or the people that you live with. Try to have them treat the situation as if you are really working at the office. Do not get pulled into family drama, or household chores. Dedicate the time to your work. Similarly, try to finish your tasks by the deadline. It is not fair either to you or your loved ones, that you take your work to the dinner table, which would mean that you have neither proper family time nor proper work time. a clear distinction between the two will let you have the best of both worlds.",
      "Work-life encroaching on family time? Remember to create a separation between the two for the best of both worlds!",
      "Get Organized!",
      "It would do you a lot of good to make a list of all the things that you would need while working from home and keeping them within easy reach. Try to think of all the things that are on your desk at your office, and bring all of them together at your home office.",
      "Remember to plan your day’s work so that you meet all the goals that you set!",
      "Communicate!",
      "When working from home it is crucial to keep in mind that you won’t have your colleagues around to ask them about things all the time. In this respect, it would do a lot of good to first establish what work needs to get done by the end of the day. a call with your employer or your project partner will help you to outline the tasks that need to be dealt with by the end of the day.",
      "As always, communication is key. Make sure your workmates are on the same page as you!",
      "Take Breaks!",
      "Research has suggested that when one works in breaks of 25-30 minutes and then takes a break for 5 minutes, the workflow becomes smoother, and the employee is more productive. It is not good for the body to remain, neck-bent over a screen and chained to the desk without relief. Once in a while, it is important to get up from your desk and take a walk, use the restroom, and listen to something more soothing than your work.",
      "And when it all gets too much, remember to take a break!",
      "During these times, it is very easy to shrug-off work. Since there is no authority that is constantly overlooking the work you’re doing, it is infinitely easier to say that you’ll do it later. Since you’re essentially in charge of yourself, it is imperative that you take responsibility and do the desired work. Home environments do not easily lend themselves to work, and these are but a few things that one could do to work easily from home.",
